This page demonstrates the SQL Command fixture in a script and a scenario.
The scenario uses two  queries.
It also shows additional methods available to analyse the returned data.

!1 Calling the SQLCommand directly in a Script

!|Define Properties|ScriptDefinition      |
|key               |value                 |
|.include          |TestDatabase          |
|cmd               |select * from TestData|

!|Script|SQLCommand|ScriptDefinition|
|openConnection                     |
|execute                            |
|show   |success                    |
|show   |rawResult                  |
|show   |resultSheet                |
|$RSOne=|resultSheet                |
|closeConnection                    |

!1 Using SQLCommand in a scenario

!2 The Scenario with two execute statements
!|Scenario|TheId               |id   |isNamed|name|andHasPhone|phone|
|execute  |select Name from TestData where ID = '@id'               |
|show     |success                                                  |
|show     |rawResult                                                |
|show     |resultSheet                                              |
|check    |getColumnValueByName|NAME |@name                         |
|#                                                                  |
|execute  |select * from TestData where ID = '@id'                  |
|show     |success                                                  |
|show     |rawResult                                                |
|show     |resultSheet                                              |
|check    |getColumnValueByName|Phone|@phone                        |



!2 Start the test
!3 Open a connection
!|Script|SQLCommand|ScriptDefinition|
|openConnection                     |


!3 Call the scenario in a Decision Table

!|The Id  Is Named And Has Phone|
|id      |name       |phone     |
|2       |Ben        |>0        |
|4       |Till       |>100      |
|3       |Tom        |>10       |
|2       |=~/Be/     |>5        |

!3 Call the scenario in a Script Table

!|script                                 |
|TheId|5|IsNamed|Sarah|AndHasPhone|999999|


!3 Close the connection
!|Script        |
